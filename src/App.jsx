						<h1 className="title">Hello my name is caike and I am here!</h1>
						<p>
							Alfonso is an alligator with an yellow-orange color, and has a
							white stomach and chin. Like any alligator, Alfonso has a nose
							that sticks out and has a huge chomper. He has 5 brown rings on
							his face and has baggy blue eyes.
						</p>

						<p>
							Alfonso's design is based on Nintendo's famous mascot Mario from
							the Super Mario Bros. series. Not only does he mimic Mario's
							famous "it'sa me" quote as his initial phrase, but he also wears
							the big bro's tee, which features the "M" emblem featured on
							Mario's cap, although the rest of the shirt is red, however, his
							shirt was changed in New Horizons to the simple parka. Alfonso's
							external appearance is a subtle reference to Yoshi, Mario's
							faithful dinosaur companion. He is a burnt-amber orange with
							darker circles on his face. Both his cheeks and belly are white
							and his eyes are similarly formed, although his eyelids are a
							light cyan blue.
