Summarizing everything, I've learned how words are formed, lot's of them I knew, but It was funny knowing more about it.",
		p2: "I really liked learning all of the ways a word can be formed, and how it changes (or not) the meaning. I kinda like the affixes, they are so usefull and, OMG I just thought about something: if you know the meaning of one of these, you instantly learn a bunch of new words, for example: the words ending -ful, is used for something in quantity, like useful, beautiful, painful. I really like that.",
		p3: "I took some notes, so I think I got the main points of what the teacher showed us, but I have to study a little bit more by my self to fix all the concepts and examples in my mind. There was so many new concepts that Iâ€™m afraid of mix some of them and go crazy on the tests.",
		p4: "I just remembered the classes in my second Teaching Practicum at UNEB, where me and Vitor taught our students a little about how word formation can help them read better not only English texts but Portuguese and so on. Knowing that helps you guess the meaning of a word you donâ€™t know (in theory). So I believe it really help in reading, and I will always use this in my classes.",
