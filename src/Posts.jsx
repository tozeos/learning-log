				<h3>What did I learn today?</h3>

				<p>
					Today I learned soo many things, some stuff I already knew, but many
					of them I never had heard about. There&rsquo;s so many categories that
					I&rsquo;ve known for so long and others that I haven&rsquo;t.
					Summarizing everything, I&rsquo;ve learned how words are formed,
					lot&rsquo;s of them I knew, but It was funny knowing more about it.
				</p>

				<h3>What did I like the most?</h3>

				<p>
					I really liked learning all of the ways a word can be formed, and how
					it changes (or not) the meaning. I kinda like the affixes, they are so
					usefull and, OMG I just thought about something: if you know the
					meaning of one of these, you instantly learn a bunch of new words, for
					example: the words ending <em>-ful</em>, is used for something in
					quantity, like <i>useful, beautiful, painful.</i> I really like that.

				<h3>What worked well? What did not?</h3>

				<p>
					I took some notes, so I think I got the main points of what the
					teacher showed us, but I have to study a little bit more by my self to
					fix all the concepts and examples in my mind. There was so many new
					concepts that I&rsquo;m afraid of mix some of them and go crazy on the
					tests.
				</p>

				<h3>How can I apply this knowledge in my English Classes?</h3>

				<p>
					I just remembered the classes in my second Teaching Practicum at UNEB,
					where me and Vitor taught our students a little about how word
					formation can help them read better not only English texts but
					Portuguese and so on. Knowing that helps you guess the meaning of a
					word you don&rsquo;t know (in theory). So I believe it really help in
					reading, and I will always use this in my classes.

				<h3>What is my grade today about participation?</h3>
